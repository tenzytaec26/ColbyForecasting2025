# Presentation

Monday, January 27

We will have a mini scientific conference where you will present your project as you might do at a scientific conference. Plan your presentation to be 10 minutes. You may use a slide show (e.g.power point), but you are also welcome to use other styles. You should aim at communicating a condensed version of what is in your project write-up. Because the project write-up isn’t due for a few more days, it is acceptable to have open-ended questions or areas where you ask the audience for feedback. At the end of the presentations, we will have a discussion that attempts to bring this collection of projects together into an integrated description of what the Gulf of Maine might look like in future decades.

Proposed content for a presentation:

**Introduction** - What is your species? Why is it important? What are some of the management, industry, or conservation decisions that could benefit from a forecast?

**Data** - What is the distribution in time and space of your data? What are the strengths, weaknesses, caveats?

**Modeling** - Go through your approach and results, including a projection to future climate conditions. It’s okay to include challenges you’re facing or unanswered questions. These can inform our discussion.

**Implications** - How does your prediction influence the decisions around this species that you discussed in the introduction? 

Your project write-up will follow a similar structure.
